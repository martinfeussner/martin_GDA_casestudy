Google Data Analytics case study work on Divvy Bikes

Here you find my R script and visuals produced while working on this case study.

The purpose of the work was to determine how annual members and casual riders use Divvy Bikes differently.

Feel free to go through the code and let me know if there is anything that can be improved on :)
